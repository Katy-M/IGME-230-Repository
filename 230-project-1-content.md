# Title
## High Concept
In this game, the player must avoid ruthless mines and enemy vehicles to deliver emergency medical supplies to the base camp.
## Genre
_Title_ is a vertically-scrolling avoidance game.

## Platform
Desktop only.

## Story
The player's mission is to safely transport medical supplies inside of the truck to the base camp. Because the player's only route to the camp passes through a war zone, there will be other vehicles and mines the player must avoid.

## Aesthetics
_Title_ is presented in a cartoonish style, but with primarily dark colors that evokes the feeling of unease. The sound will be 8-bit, occuring when the player collides with another vehicle or a mine. The background scrolls behind the player.

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player has the ability to move left and right on the screen, but not forward or backward. Enemy vehicles and mines will move towards the player, forcing the player to dodge. The player will also have a health bar that will allow them to take a small number of hits before the game is over.
### Control
The player can move up or down using the arrow keys.
### Teaching the Game
The player will see a screen displaying the mission objective, enemy and mine information, and controls upon starting a game.
### Player Learning
In order to beat the game, the player must be paying close attention to their surroundings and what lies ahead.
